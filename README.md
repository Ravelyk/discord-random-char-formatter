# discord-random-char-formatter
A small script that adds random discord text formatting symbols

*Known bug: The script may run into infinite loop, re-run it in this case

Reads the input string, and for each Char it will add one of the few format symbols that discord allows

ex: *, **, ~, __, _, etc

Update notes:
Update 27/03/2022 by Victor Davidescu - Made the script nicer and added a loop for the program.
